         <p id="sample-para" style = "color:black">
            COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that emerged in December 2019.
            COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the world as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illness.
            The coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
         </p>

         <p>
            Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 
         </p>
         <h2>Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?</h2>
         <p> Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started. <br>

            SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.  <br>
            
            Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.</p>

         <h2> How to Prevent Yourself ?</h2>
         <p>
         With the following preventions , we can protect ourself 
        </p>
        <p>
        With the following ways , we can save our and other's life -
         

        </p>
        

        
        

        <ol>
        <li> <h3> Washing hands  </h3> </li>
        <p>
            Multiple times a day, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

        <li>
            <h3>Wearing mask</h3>
            <p>So to curb the spread of COVID-19, wearing masks in important. Protective masks are said to lower the chances of coronavirus entering our respiratory system through droplets that are present in the air.</p>

        </li>
        

       
       <li> <h3> Avoid contact </h3> </li>
       <p>
        Avoid close contact with people who are sick or who have symptops such as fever , cold , cough etc.
    </p>
            
       

       
       <li> <h3> Inculating habit of using sanitizer frequently </h3> </li>
       <p>
        Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you have symptoms of acute respiratory illness.
      </p>
      </ul>

      
      <li> <h3> Social Distancing </h3> </li>
      <p>
        Social or physical distancing is just that -- keep a minimum space between yourself and others.

    </p>
      

      
      <li> <h3> Isolation and Quarantine </h3> </li>
      <p>
        Isolation is used to separate people infected with COVID-19 from those who are not infected.
      <br>
        People who are in isolation should stay home until it’s safe for them to be around others. At home, 
        anyone sick or infected should separate from others, stay in a specific “sick room” or area, and use 
        a separate bathroom (if available).
        <br>
        Quarantine if you have been in close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes
        or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who has COVID-19, unless you have been fully vaccinated. People
        who are fully vaccinated do NOT need to quarantine after contact with someone who had COVID-19 unless they
         have symptoms.
      </p>
      

      
      <li> <h3> Getting tested </h3> </li>
      <p>

    <h2>why there are many variants of Covid-19?</h2>
  <p>  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has mutated (changed), resulting in different variants of the virus. One of these is called the delta variant (arising from Pango lineage B. 1.617. 2). <br>Mutations in viruses — including the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic — are neither new nor unexpected. Bollinger explains: “All RNA viruses mutate over time, some more than others. For example, flu viruses change often, which is why doctors recommend that you get a new flu vaccine every year.

<b><u>Variants of Concern </u></b>
<p>
    Working definition: <br>
    A SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see below) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance: 
    <ul>
        <li>Increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR</li>
   
    <li>Increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR</li>
    <li>Decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics.  </li>
</ul>

  <h2>Have a look on different Variants of Covid-19  -</h2>
  <ol>

<li>
   <b><u>Alpha(B.1.1.7)</u></b> 
   <p>
    The variant known as Alpha or B.1.1.7 or 201/501Y.V1 was first detected in the UK

    mutations.
    
    This variant emerged with an unusual large number of The spread of this variant greatly affected a surge of COVID
    
    19 cases in UK since November, 2021. The variant comprises roughly 95% of new SARS-CoV-2
    
    infections in England. The variant has now been identified in at least 114
    
    countries.
    
    #Importantly, this variant spreads more easily and quickly than other previously known variants. Indeed, the variant has shown 30-50% enhanced transmissibility compared to initially emerged SARS-CoV-2.

   </p>
</li>
<li>
<b><u> Beta(B.1.351)    </u></b>
<p>
    The variant known as Beta, or B.1.351, was first detected in

    South Africa
    
    This variant emerged with an unusually large number of mutations in South Africa.
    
    As the variant spreads faster than other earlier variants of the virus, the variant may be driving the second wave of the pandemic in the country.
    
    This variant is spreading globally (at least 48 different
    
    countries).
    
    The variant was detected in at least 23 states in the U.S (a
    
    total of 143 cases). Notable mutations: N501Y, K417N, and E484K in the
    
    receptor binding domain of spike protein, which can enhance its affinity to the human ACE2 receptor. The E484K mutation might lead to escape from the immune response

</p>
</li>
<li>
<b><u> Gamma(P.1 )      </u></b>

    The variant known as Gamma or P.1 was first detected in Brazil

It has caused widespread infection in the city of Manaus.

As shown with other UK and South African variants, the Brazilian variant has shown to enhanced transmissibility and is spreading globally.

Notable mutations: N501Y, K417N, and E484K in the receptor binding domain of spike protein, which can enhance its affinity to the human ACE2 receptor.

The E484K mutation might lead to escape from the immune response
</p>
</li>
<li>
    <b><u>Delta Variant(B.1.617.2)</u> </b>
   <p>
       Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has mutated (changed), resulting in different variants of the virus. One of these is called the delta variant (arising from Pango lineage B.1.617.2). The delta coronavirus is considered a “variant of concern” by the WHO and CDC because it appears to be more easily transmitted from one person to another. As of September 2021, delta is regarded as the most contagious form of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus so far.
       
   </p>
   </li>

<li>
<b><u> Omicron(B.1.1.529)      </u></b>
<p>
    WHO has acknowledged that Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant, but there are still many questions about how much of a growth rate and/or transmission advantage Omicron has over the other VOCs. According to the preprint of a study conducted in South Africa, Omicron demonstrated exponential growth over a 4-week period in Gauteng (Nov. 8-Dec.5, 2021) and spread with an estimated doubling time of 3.2-3.6 days. This is larger than, but comparable to, the doubling times of the first COVID-19 outbreaks, which occurred in spring 2020 when prior immunity was nonexistent and intervention methods were not yet in place.

    Researchers from the University of Hong Kong reported that Omicron pseudovirus multiplied 70 times faster than Delta and the original SARS-CoV-2 strain in human bronchus tissue in the lab. Yet it replicated nearly 10 times less efficiently in lung tissue than the original strain, which may be an indicator of lower disease severity.

  Covid warriors are pillors of protection .
  Many of them have lost their kin but have moved on undaunted, in the service of society
Life is so uncertain and every minute that we breathe is a miracle, because we escape from so many dangers that could snatch our lives! During the pandemic, this thought has only got strengthened. If I am well, I am blessed and lucky so far. I don’t know what destiny has in store for me! When I read about the past pandemic which occurred a 100 years ago, it is chilling that life continued after that and we are all alive and kicking! If at all we survive the present pandemic, we have millions of stories to tell!
